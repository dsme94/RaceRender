# RaceRender

This project pieces together the objects required for sector timing in RaceRender. 

Sector timing works by calculating GPS positioning from the start line to each sector based on distance. You can typically find the distance between each sector by typing the track name in Google followed by 'sector distances'.

The ones supplied in this repository are for Knockhill.

It is a requirement to modify the background script of the Sector Timing object to update for new circuits.
